## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Package won't load
**Solution:**
```r
# Reinstall dependencies
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "magick", "imager"))

# Reload package
devtools::load_all()
```

### Issue: Functions not found
**Solution:**
```r
# Re-document and reload
devtools::document()
devtools::load_all()
```

### Issue: App won't launch
**Solution:**
1. Check R console for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Try running test script: `source("test_morph_module.R")`

### Issue: Images won't display
**Solution:**
1. Verify `magick` is installed: `library(magick)`
2. Check file format is supported
3. Try with a simple PNG image first

### Issue: Morphing fails
**Solution:**
1. Verify `imager` is installed: `library(imager)`
2. Check split images were created successfully
3. Try with simpler parameters (fewer steps, linear method)
